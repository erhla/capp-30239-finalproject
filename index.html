        <h1>Property Taxes</h1>
        <h5>Homes are supposed to be assessed based on how much they would sell for, independent of how much money they are worth. Yet, this analysis shows that lower value homes pay more than higher value homes. This map directly calculates this rate, where if a state or county had a value of 1, poor and rich homes are assessed at the same rate. If the value is .5, poor homes are assessed at twice the rate of rich homes.</h5>
